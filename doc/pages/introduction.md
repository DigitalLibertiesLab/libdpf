# Introduction

## Synopsis {#synopsis}

`libdpf++` is a fast and extensible, header-only C++17 implementation of
`(2,2)-`*distributed point functions* (or *DPFs*). In addition to core DPF
functionality, `libdpf++` provides a plethora of data structures, helper
functions, and syntactic sugar designed to facilitate seamless integration
into higher-level cryptographic protocols and primitives. With its focus on
speed and ease of use, `libdpf++` is an ideal building block for implementing
private information retrieval (PIR), secure multiparty computation (MPC),
zero-knowledge arguments, anonymous messaging, and more.
